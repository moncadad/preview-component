## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Better understood how to use grids, how to set border radius in component like this, and pseudo selectors. Reduced code by using React and Sass making code dyanamic. Also made an effort to implement semantic html layout.

I'm feeeling mighty proud I cut code, and time by half and the UI is pretty spot on to the design!

```html
With the use of React array map method I reduced code to 50lines
```

```css
  Pseudo selectors, combining repeated patterns into common selectors.
```

```js
  Big proud of my use of array map method over my data array of car info!
```

### Continued development

I think i'm on a steady growth flow. For future projects I intend to implement more JS to make code more dynamic. I'm becoming more familiar with sass. Maybe diving a tad more into it and trying new tactics would be beneficial or even learning frameworks like bootstrap. That reminds me grid is a big curve so thats definetly something I intent to learn more in depth.

Unrelated to this project I plan on learning api's also algorithms seems that they're importand in our field.
Theres also a ton of design principles and trends I can't wait to try!
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT!! ðŸ˜Ž
